SOLUTION
  subtask 1:
    - answs are all integers
    - no need for floats and all that bs
    - bosed on the dir of the ith needle, we can know the (i+1)th needle
    - calc needle heads by 1 by 1

  subtask 3:
    - after 4 seconds ALL needles will rotate back to original poistions
    - only 4 possible answers (T = 0,1,2,3)

  subtask 2:
    - sum up all coords <-- vector addition
    - O(NQ)

  subtask 4:
    - instead of calcing the roation degrees for each query, 
        we can sum the rotation speeds (since independent)
    - then multiply by time of each query
    - S = S mod 3600 --> 3600 groups

  subtask 5:
    - use subtask 3, when S_i only had 4 values, 4 answers
    - now S_i only has 3600 values, only 3600 answers
    - precompute
    - constant time needs to be small though
